## ELECTRIC VEHICLE DATASET - POWER BI:
This project explores an Electric Vehicle dataset sourced from Kaggle to understand how pricing, efficiency, powertrains, and rapid‐charging capability vary across different EV models. I cleaned the dataset in Excel and built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to present meaningful insights in a simple, visual way.

# Project Overview:

Data Cleaning (Excel):

I prepared the dataset by:

	•	Standardizing numeric fields such as price (€), range, efficiency, seats, and acceleration
	•	Fixing inconsistent text fields (body type, plug type, brand, powertrain)
	•	Verifying rapid-charging values — 98 vehicles support rapid charging, and 5 do not
	•	Removing duplicates and ensuring the data was ready for analysis in Power BI

Power BI Dashboard:

The dashboard provides clear, data-driven insights using:

	•	Pie chart: Total price (€) by body style
	•	Bar chart: Seat counts by brand (BMW, Hyundai, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Tesla, etc.)
	•	Donut chart: Efficiency distribution across powertrains (AWD, FWD, RWD)
  
Additional visuals covering:

	•	Rapid-charging availability 
	•	Battery capacity vs. range 
	•	Plug type distribution 
	•	Acceleration and top-speed comparisons

Tools Used:

	•	Power BI Desktop
	•	Microsoft Excel
	•	Kaggle Dataset
  
Dataset Note:

This repository includes my cleaned version of the dataset, since I made several edits in Excel.
